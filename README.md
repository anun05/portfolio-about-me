## Description
This porfolio is about me and who I am and where I cam from. I did my best to make it resemble the person I am. The first time I developed this work, it was very difficult for me, although there are some challenges still, I feel like I have gotten the hang of CSS and HTML. The layout of the porfolio is simple and easy to use as you can be directed to any of the sections in the porfolio. The struggles I mostly had were uploading it all to gitHub. Overall, I plan to keep updating this work as I progress as a developer.
