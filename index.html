            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> Hello everyone! You guys can call me Alex or Nunez; either is fine. I go by mostly Nunez, but I have
                no preference. I was born in LA Bellflower, to be exact. I lived in Paramount for a bit before
                moving to Riverside. I grew up in Riverside with little memory of LA. In High School, I was very
                active. I played three sports all four years and was also ASB President. After High School, I attend
                the University of California, Los Angeles. Also known as UCLA, the number one Public University in
                the nation. </p>
            <p> I started as a physics major but then changed to Political Science. I made this change in my third
                year at UCLA. Thinking I would not be able to graduate, I pushed myself to take as many classes as I
                could each quarter, and with that, I was about to catch up and graduate in 2021. </p>
            <P>I currently work at In-N-Out burger and have been there for five years now. They have treated me with
                lots of respect and have helped me throughout High School and college. I enjoy working out and
                trying to become better version of myself. </P>
