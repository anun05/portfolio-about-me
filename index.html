        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hello everyone! You guys can call me Alex or Nunez; either is fine. I
          go by mostly Nunez, but I have no preference. I was born in LA
          Bellflower, to be exact. I lived in Paramount for a bit before moving
          to Riverside. I grew up in Riverside with little memory of LA. In High
          School, I was very active. I played three sports all four years and
          was also ASB President. After High School, I attend the University of
          California, Los Angeles. Also known as UCLA, the number one Public
          University in the nation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started as a physics major but then changed to Political Science. I
          made this change in my third year at UCLA. Thinking I would not be
          able to graduate, I pushed myself to take as many classes as I could
          each quarter, and with that, I was about to catch up and graduate in
          2021.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently work at In-N-Out burger and have been there for five years
          now. They have treated me with lots of respect and have helped me
          throughout High School and college. I enjoy working out and trying to
          become better version of myself.

            This is my Second project and it is called "NFT generator." The
            project was created by three of us, John, Alex (me), Israel. This
            Website works along side a wallet ( such as meta mask ), pinata (
            another application ), and mnay different npm packages.
